<b>Philippians 1-4</b>
<b>English Standard Version</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Greeting</b>
<br/><br/>
1 Paul and Timothy, servants of <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>,
<br/><br/>
To <span class="group4">all</span> the saints in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:
<br/><br/>
2 Grace to you and peace from <span class="group3">God</span> our Father and the <span class="group5">Lord</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span>.
<br/><br/>
<b>Thanksgiving and Prayer</b>
<br/><br/>
3 I thank my <span class="group3">God</span> in <span class="group4">all</span> my remembrance of you, 4 always in every prayer of mine for you <span class="group4">all</span> making my prayer with <span class="group11">joy</span>, 5 <span class="group10">because</span> of your partnership in the <span class="group6">gospel</span> from the first day until now. 6 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span>. 7 It is right for me to feel this way about you <span class="group4">all</span>, <span class="group10">because</span> I hold you in my heart, for you are <span class="group4">all</span> partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the <span class="group6">gospel</span>. 8 For <span class="group3">God</span> is my witness, how I yearn for you <span class="group4">all</span> with the affection of <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>. 9 And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and <span class="group4">all</span> discernment, 10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of <span class="group1">Christ</span>, 11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span>, to the <span class="group8">glory</span> and praise of <span class="group3">God</span>.
<br/><br/>
<b>The Advance of the <span class="group6">gospel</span></b>
<br/><br/>
12 I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has re<span class="group4">all</span>y served to advance the <span class="group6">gospel</span>, 13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to <span class="group4">all</span> the rest that my imprisonment is for <span class="group1">Christ</span>. 14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the <span class="group5">Lord</span> by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
<br/><br/>
15 Some indeed preach <span class="group1">Christ</span> from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. 16 The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the <span class="group6">gospel</span>. 17 The former proclaim <span class="group1">Christ</span> out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. 18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, <span class="group1">Christ</span> is proclaimed, and in that I <span class="group9">rejoice</span>.
<br/><br/>
<b>To Live Is <span class="group1">Christ</span></b>
<br/><br/>
Yes, and I will <span class="group9">rejoice</span>, 19 for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span> this will turn out for my deliverance, 20 as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at <span class="group4">all</span> ashamed, but that with full courage now as always <span class="group1">Christ</span> will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me to live is <span class="group1">Christ</span>, and to die is gain. 22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I sh<span class="group4">all</span> choose I cannot tell. 23 I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with <span class="group1">Christ</span>, for that is far better. 24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. 25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you <span class="group4">all</span>, for your progress and <span class="group11">joy</span> in the faith, 26 so that in me you may have ample cause to <span class="group8">glory</span> in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>, <span class="group10">because</span> of my coming to you again.
<br/><br/>
27 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the <span class="group6">gospel</span> of <span class="group1">Christ</span>, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the <span class="group6">gospel</span>, 28 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from <span class="group3">God</span>. 29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of <span class="group1">Christ</span> you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, 30 engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
<br/><br/>
<b><span class="group1">Christ</span>'s Example of Humility</b>
<br/><br/>
2 So if there is any encouragement in <span class="group1">Christ</span>, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 2 complete my <span class="group11">joy</span> by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. 4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>, 6 who, though he was in the form of <span class="group3">God</span>, did not count equality with <span class="group3">God</span> a thing to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 9 Therefore <span class="group3">God</span> has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, 10 so that at the name of <span class="group2">Jesus</span> every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span> is <span class="group5">Lord</span>, to the <span class="group8">glory</span> of <span class="group3">God</span> the Father.
<br/><br/>
<b>Lights in the World</b>
<br/><br/>
12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, 13 for it is <span class="group3">God</span> who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
<br/><br/>
14 Do <span class="group4">all</span> things without grumbling or disputing, 15 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of <span class="group3">God</span> without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 16 holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of <span class="group1">Christ</span> I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 17 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and <span class="group9">rejoice</span> with you <span class="group4">all</span>. 18 Likewise you also should be glad and <span class="group9">rejoice</span> with me.
<br/><br/>
<b>Timothy and Epaphroditus</b>
<br/><br/>
19 I hope in the <span class="group5">Lord</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. 20 For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. 21 For they <span class="group4">all</span> seek their own interests, not those of <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span>. 22 But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the <span class="group6">gospel</span>. 23 I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, 24 and I trust in the <span class="group5">Lord</span> that shortly I myself will come also.
<br/><br/>
25 I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, 26 for he has been longing for you <span class="group4">all</span> and has been distressed <span class="group10">because</span> you heard that he was ill. 27 Indeed he was ill, near to death. But <span class="group3">God</span> had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may <span class="group9">rejoice</span> at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. 29 So receive him in the <span class="group5">Lord</span> with <span class="group4">all</span> <span class="group11">joy</span>, and honor such men, 30 for he nearly died for the work of <span class="group1">Christ</span>, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.
<br/><br/>
<b>Righteousness Through Faith in <span class="group1">Christ</span></b>
<br/><br/>
3 Fin<span class="group4">all</span>y, my brothers, <span class="group9">rejoice</span> in the <span class="group5">Lord</span>. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.
<br/><br/>
2 Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. 3 For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of <span class="group3">God</span> and <span class="group8">glory</span> in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> and put no confidence in the flesh— 4 though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 5 circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; 6 as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. 7 But <span class="group7">whatever</span> gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of <span class="group1">Christ</span>. 8 Indeed, I count everything as loss <span class="group10">because</span> of the surpassing worth of knowing <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> my <span class="group5">Lord</span>. For his sake I have suffered the loss of <span class="group4">all</span> things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain <span class="group1">Christ</span> 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in <span class="group1">Christ</span>, the righteousness from <span class="group3">God</span> that depends on faith— 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
<br/><br/>
<b>Straining Toward the Goal</b>
<br/><br/>
12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, <span class="group10">because</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> has made me his own. 13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward c<span class="group4">all</span> of <span class="group3">God</span> in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>. 15 Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, <span class="group3">God</span> will reveal that also to you. 16 Only let us hold true to what we have attained.
<br/><br/>
17 Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. 18 For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of <span class="group1">Christ</span>. 19 Their end is destruction, their <span class="group3">God</span> is their belly, and they <span class="group8">glory</span> in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. 20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the <span class="group5">Lord</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span>, 21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject <span class="group4">all</span> things to himself.
<br/><br/>
4 Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my <span class="group11">joy</span> and crown, stand firm thus in the <span class="group5">Lord</span>, my beloved.
<br/><br/>
<b>Exhortation, Encouragement, and Prayer</b>
<br/><br/>
2 I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the <span class="group5">Lord</span>. 3 Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women, who have labored side by side with me in the <span class="group6">gospel</span> together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
<br/><br/>
4 <span class="group9">rejoice</span> in the <span class="group5">Lord</span> always; again I will say, <span class="group9">rejoice</span>. 5 Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The <span class="group5">Lord</span> is at hand; 6 do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to <span class="group3">God</span>. 7 And the peace of <span class="group3">God</span>, which surpasses <span class="group4">all</span> understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>.
<br/><br/>
8 Fin<span class="group4">all</span>y, brothers, <span class="group7">whatever</span> is true, <span class="group7">whatever</span> is honorable, <span class="group7">whatever</span> is just, <span class="group7">whatever</span> is pure, <span class="group7">whatever</span> is lovely, <span class="group7">whatever</span> is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 9 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the <span class="group3">God</span> of peace will be with you.
<br/><br/>
<b><span class="group3">God</span>'s Provision</b>
<br/><br/>
10 I <span class="group9">rejoice</span>d in the <span class="group5">Lord</span> greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. 11 Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in <span class="group7">whatever</span> situation I am to be content. 12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. 13 I can do <span class="group4">all</span> things through him who strengthens me.
<br/><br/>
14 Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. 15 And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the <span class="group6">gospel</span>, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. 16 Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. 17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. 18 I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to <span class="group3">God</span>. 19 And my <span class="group3">God</span> will supply every need of yours according to his riches in <span class="group8">glory</span> in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>. 20 To our <span class="group3">God</span> and Father be <span class="group8">glory</span> forever and ever. Amen.
<br/><br/>
<b>Final Greetings</b>
<br/><br/>
21 Greet every saint in <span class="group1">Christ</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span>. The brothers who are with me greet you. 22 <span class="group4">all</span> the saints greet you, especi<span class="group4">all</span>y those of Caesar's household.
<br/><br/>
23 The grace of the <span class="group5">Lord</span> <span class="group2">Jesus</span> <span class="group1">Christ</span> be with your spirit.
